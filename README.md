# World_Weather_Analysis
BootCamp Challenge Week6 **Using APIÂ´s to visualize Data**
## Overview
  For this week, we will help the travel company Planmytrip which offer its clients a variety of travel options depending on the weather they prefer. For this we will use the Google maps platform, API requests and Jupyter maps. 
  
## Results
  We started by generating a file with random coordinates, from this we filter the places with  temperatures below a maximun deteminated, and the results were store in a database *Weatherpy_Database*. From there, according to the client's weather preference, we show them a Google map with the places that fit their selection with a hotel option.

  Subsequently, the client is asked to refine the search based in its weather preference, and then, assuming that the client has chosen 4 places to visit (in this case, we chose the North of Spain), and we presented  a Google map with a proposed route to visit the places and another map  with its correspondent hotel options.

## Summary 
For me, this project seemed very illustrative about the management of APIs to get information that already exists and it can be consulted.  In this project we consulted Google Maps combining the knowledge acquired from Python, Pandas, Mathplotlib. A very good resume for this knowledge.
